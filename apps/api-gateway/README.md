# Documents for api gateway

`api-gateway` is placed under infras/ since it acts as infrastructure (configuration/proxy) to handle routing between services rather than `a standalone application` (with custom code: NestJS, Express, FastAPI, etc.).

how to run:

- move to this folder
- run `docker compose up -d`
- that's it (for now)
